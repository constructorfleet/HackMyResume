                    <p>Teagan&#39;s ability to look at a complex problem and reduce it, quickly
                        I might add, into an extendable and reusable architecture is surpassed
                        by no software engineer I have ever worked with. In the matter of 3 hours
                        she had designed and beta spec&#39;ed the architecture for a commission/invoice
                        integration with a financial system; it was approved by the client in ONE
                        meeting. I have had the pleasure of knowing Teagan for the past three years
                        now, and have worked side by side with her for the last year. I can say
                        without a doubt that if she quit her current job, I&#39;d likely be applying
                        to her new job; She is that great to work with, always honest and always
                        knowledgeable of the task at hand. Teagan is a relentless scholar, either
                        from the academic perspective nearly having four degrees to the community
                        side and her continual contribution to open source. Teagan also is enthralled
                        with automation and has taken it upon herself to automate her home and
                        daily life where possible.</p>

                     <h3><em>Alan Janis</em></h3>
                    <p>Teagan is the kind of engineer who can be intimidating to work with because
                        of her breadth and depth of knowledge, and ability to pick up new software,
                        skills, and practices seemingly overnight. However, she is wiling to share
                        and even mentor in these areas which I feel increases her value to her
                        team, the company, and outside members of any project that she is tasked
                        with. I know that she sometimes struggles with how her message comes across
                        in conversation, but she is quick to acknowledge a mistake, take it to
                        heart, apologize and take corrective action. Teagan is a fantastic asset
                        and addition to any team or project, not just because of her skill set,
                        but because of her diligence and experience taking point on difficult projects
                        and tasks, seeing them through to completion. She has technical mastery
                        of many programming languages, architectures, development methodologies,
                        and well as significant knowledge of underlying systems (bare metal, KVM,
                        cloud providers, etc.)</p>

                     <h3><em>Aram Hamper</em></h3>
                    <p>Teagan has been a joy to work with. I’ve been on two engagements with
                        her now, and she consistently brings positive energy. She is intelligent,
                        confident, outspoken, and opinionated, and I mean those things for the
                        compliment that they are. Teagan is also humble, caring, kind, and not
                        afraid to admit when she is wrong. She is considerate of the feelings of
                        others and quick to resolve conflict. Teagan has a passion for continuous
                        improvement, particularly when it comes to automation. She loves to share
                        her work with others whenever given a chance. She loves to teach and has
                        a lot of good things to share. When I expressed a desire to understand
                        programming better, she started a class for people like me. On the Psyclops
                        Team, she paired with developers (regardless of the stack) and QAs and
                        brought a wealth of value in her first few days as an employee. On the
                        JPMC-NAIC automation project, she quickly picked up on abstract concepts
                        she had previously had little experience with.</p>

                     <h3><em>Brandon Dorris</em></h3>
                    <p>Teagan is eager to learn and even more eager to help others. While at
                        Metropolitan State College of Denver, I had the opportunity to be in a
                        few classes with Teagan. She was always on top of her work and always had
                        innovative solutions for problems we worked on together. Teagan would be
                        a great addition to any team given her excellent work ethic and her willingness
                        to take on a leadership role.</p>

                     <h3><em>Kurt Dageforde</em></h3>
                    <p>Teagan is a highly intelligent, creative, and driven software engineer.
                        We shared an office for over a year and worked on several projects together.
                        She had created a highly complex heat balance program from scratch, and
                        I was constantly impressed with her ability to troubleshoot and improve
                        the software. I can confidently endorse Teagan&#39;s ability as a software
                        engineer and have no doubt that she would be an asset to any company.</p>
