    <h3><em>James Gibson</em></h3>
    <p>Teagan&#39;s ability to look at a complex problem and reduce it, quickly I might add, into an extendable and reusable architecture is surpassed by no software engineer I have ever worked with. In the matter of 3 hours she had designed and beta spec&#39;ed the architecture for a commission/invoice integration with a financial system; it was approved by the client in ONE meeting. 
I have had the pleasure of knowing Teagan for the past three years now, and have worked side by side with her for the last year. I can say without a doubt that if she quit her current job, I&#39;d likely be applying to her new job; She is that great to work with, always honest and always knowledgeable of the task at hand. 
Teagan is a relentless scholar, either from the academic perspective nearly having four degrees to the community side and her continual contribution to open source. Teagan also is enthralled with automation and has taken it upon herself to automate her home and daily life where possible.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3><em>Alan Janis</em></h3>
    <p>Teagan is the kind of engineer who can be intimidating to work with  because of her breadth and depth of knowledge, and ability to pick up new  software, skills, and practices seemingly overnight. However, she is wiling to share and even mentor in these areas which I feel increases her value to her team,  the company, and outside members of any project that she is tasked with.  I know that she sometimes struggles with how her message comes across in conversation, but she is quick to acknowledge a mistake, take it to heart, apologize and take  corrective action. Teagan is a fantastic asset and addition to any team or project, not just because of her skill set, but because of her diligence and experience taking point on difficult projects and tasks, seeing them through to completion.  She has technical mastery of many programming languages, architectures, development  methodologies, and well as significant knowledge of underlying systems  (bare metal, KVM, cloud providers, etc.)</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3><em>Aram Hamper</em></h3>
    <p>Teagan has been a joy to work with. I’ve been on two engagements with her now, and she  consistently brings positive energy. She is intelligent, confident, outspoken, and  opinionated, and I mean those things for the compliment that they are. Teagan is also  humble, caring, kind, and not afraid to admit when she is wrong. She is considerate  of the feelings of others and quick to resolve conflict. Teagan has a passion for  continuous improvement, particularly when it comes to automation. She loves to share  her work with others whenever given a chance. She loves to teach and has a lot of good  things to share. When I expressed a desire to understand programming better, she started  a class for people like me. On the Psyclops Team, she paired with developers (regardless  of the stack) and QAs and brought a wealth of value in her first few days as an employee.  On the JPMC-NAIC automation project, she quickly picked up on abstract concepts she had  previously had little experience with.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3><em>Brandon Dorris</em></h3>
    <p>Teagan is eager to learn and even more eager to help others. While at Metropolitan State  College of Denver, I had the opportunity to be in a few classes with Teagan. She was  always on top of her work and always had innovative solutions for problems we worked on  together. Teagan would be a great addition to any team given her excellent work ethic and  her willingness to take on a leadership role.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h3><em>Kurt Dageforde</em></h3>
    <p>Teagan is a highly intelligent, creative, and driven software engineer. We shared an office  for over a year and worked on several projects together. She had created a highly complex  heat balance program from scratch, and I was constantly impressed with her ability to  troubleshoot and improve the software. I can confidently endorse Teagan&#39;s ability as a  software engineer and have no doubt that she would be an asset to any company.</p>
