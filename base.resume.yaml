      highlights:
        - Leading innovative technical and philosophical changes to Resideo's core platform of widely used professional and consumer-connected home products.
        - Migrated all subgraphs and gateways from Apollo Server 2 using NexusJs to Apollo Server v4 using NestJS.
        - Worked with engineers from various teams to improve their understanding and use of GraphQL, software design patterns, and other SDLC areas.
        - Implemented a self-validating, self-documenting pattern via GraphQL custom scalars and types. 
        - Led a team of 3 in developing new features and leading changes toward best practices.
        - To improve the quality of team deliverables, instituted guidelines and tooling around the review process, testing patterns and implementation, and code style.
        - Initiated group and individual lessons that enabled a cohesive understanding of frameworks, tools, and patterns.

      position: Senior Delivery Engineer
      url: https://www.wwt.com
      highlights:
        - Found solutions to deliver the product, from development, UX, QA, DevOps and more.
        - Initiated a working group to facilitate cross-functional best practices and to reduce “imposter syndrome”.
        - Work on an internal sales tool that allows clients to assess their current state and where WWT can help improve/educate.
        - A top client, to keep the multi-million dollar per year contract, requested a verifiable report detailing the interconnections match the explicit specifications within 6 weeks. Tasked to me, as one of the few who had the skills and knowledge needed. I presented to the client, 5 weeks later, the solution I had designed, built, and deployed; which later received 3 separate awards for its success. - A service that utilized in-band and out-of-band connections matching source ports to their destination port through the use of IP tables, ARP tables, IPMI, Redfish, iLO, iDRAC, and LLDP automated validation of in-band and out-of-band network connections between servers, switches, and routers using Ansible to traverse the network connections.
        - Performing validation, remediation, and verification on hundreds of devices a day is a major bottleneck in WWT's supply chain, made even worse due to the one-off solutions each ITC team seems to have come up with themselves. Working with a solutions architect, we built a framework to discover servers, switches, routers, and storage devices using services like mDNS, PXE, iPXE, and DHCP; and generate detailed reports using numerous CLI tools, BMC management tools, and on-board RedFish REST API. Facilitating fully automated validation of internal hardware against expected build configurations, remediation of firmware versions, and upgrading the operating system to match required specifications. Providing a single, fully automated solution that, for our test team, improved throughput from 10 a day to 60 devices a day without any errors.

      Teagan's ability to look at a complex problem and reduce it, quickly I
      might add, into an extendable and reusable architecture is surpassed by no
      software engineer I have ever worked with. In the matter of 3 hours she
      had designed and beta spec'ed the architecture for a commission/invoice
      integration with a financial system; it was approved by the client in ONE
      meeting. 
      
      I have had the pleasure of knowing Teagan for the past three years now,
      and have worked side by side with her for the last year. I can say without
      a doubt that if she quit her current job, I'd likely be applying to her
      new job; She is that great to work with, always honest and always
      knowledgeable of the task at hand. 
      
      Teagan is a relentless scholar, either from the academic perspective
      nearly having four degrees to the community side and her continual
      contribution to open source. Teagan also is enthralled with automation and
      has taken it upon herself to automate her home and daily life where
      possible.
  - name: Alan Janis
    quote: >-
      Teagan is the kind of engineer who can be intimidating to work with 
      because of her breadth and depth of knowledge, and ability to pick up new 
      software, skills, and practices seemingly overnight. However, she is wiling to
      share and even mentor in these areas which I feel increases her value to her team, 
      the company, and outside members of any project that she is tasked with. 
      I know that she sometimes struggles with how her message comes across in conversation,
      but she is quick to acknowledge a mistake, take it to heart, apologize and take 
      corrective action. Teagan is a fantastic asset and addition to any team or project,
      not just because of her skill set, but because of her diligence and experience taking
      point on difficult projects and tasks, seeing them through to completion. 
      She has technical mastery of many programming languages, architectures, development 
      methodologies, and well as significant knowledge of underlying systems 
      (bare metal, KVM, cloud providers, etc.)

      Teagan has been a joy to work with. I’ve been on two engagements with her now, and she 
      consistently brings positive energy. She is intelligent, confident, outspoken, and 
      opinionated, and I mean those things for the compliment that they are. Teagan is also 
      humble, caring, kind, and not afraid to admit when she is wrong. She is considerate 
      of the feelings of others and quick to resolve conflict. Teagan has a passion for 
      continuous improvement, particularly when it comes to automation. She loves to share 
      her work with others whenever given a chance. She loves to teach and has a lot of good 
      things to share. When I expressed a desire to understand programming better, she started 
      a class for people like me. On the Psyclops Team, she paired with developers (regardless 
      of the stack) and QAs and brought a wealth of value in her first few days as an employee. 
      On the JPMC-NAIC automation project, she quickly picked up on abstract concepts she had 
      previously had little experience with.

      Teagan is eager to learn and even more eager to help others. While at Metropolitan State 
      College of Denver, I had the opportunity to be in a few classes with Teagan. She was 
      always on top of her work and always had innovative solutions for problems we worked on 
      together. Teagan would be a great addition to any team given her excellent work ethic and 
      her willingness to take on a leadership role.
  - name: Kurt Dageforde
    quote: >-
      Teagan is a highly intelligent, creative, and driven software engineer. We shared an office 
      for over a year and worked on several projects together. She had created a highly complex 
      heat balance program from scratch, and I was constantly impressed with her ability to 
      troubleshoot and improve the software. I can confidently endorse Teagan's ability as a 
      software engineer and have no doubt that she would be an asset to any company.
