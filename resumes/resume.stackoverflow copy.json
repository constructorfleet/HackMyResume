In the matter of 3 hours she had designed and beta spec'ed the architecture for a commission/invoice integration with a financial system; it was approved by the client in ONE meeting. \nI have had the pleasure of knowing Teagan for the past three years now, and have worked side by side with her for the last year. I can say without a doubt that if she quit her current job, I'd likely be applying to her new job; She is that great to work with, always honest and always knowledgeable of the task at hand. \nTeagan is a relentless scholar, either from the academic perspective nearly having four degrees to the community side and her continual contribution to open source. Teagan also is enthralled with automation and has taken it upon herself to automate her home and daily life where possible."

However, she is wiling to share and even mentor in these areas which I feel increases her value to her team,  the company, and outside members of any project that she is tasked with.  I know that she sometimes struggles with how her message comes across in conversation, but she is quick to acknowledge a mistake, take it to heart, apologize and take  corrective action. Teagan is a fantastic asset and addition to any team or project, not just because of her skill set, but because of her diligence and experience taking point on difficult projects and tasks, seeing them through to completion.  She has technical mastery of many programming languages, architectures, development  methodologies, and well as significant knowledge of underlying systems  (bare metal, KVM, cloud providers, etc.)"

She is intelligent, confident, outspoken, and  opinionated, and I mean those things for the compliment that they are. Teagan is also  humble, caring, kind, and not afraid to admit when she is wrong. She is considerate  of the feelings of others and quick to resolve conflict. Teagan has a passion for  continuous improvement, particularly when it comes to automation. She loves to share  her work with others whenever given a chance. She loves to teach and has a lot of good  things to share. When I expressed a desire to understand programming better, she started  a class for people like me. On the Psyclops Team, she paired with developers (regardless  of the stack) and QAs and brought a wealth of value in her first few days as an employee.  On the JPMC-NAIC automation project, she quickly picked up on abstract concepts she had  previously had little experience with."
